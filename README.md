## Luxe Coding Challenges

A collection of coding challenges for Luxe Engineering.

***
#### Description
Create a service that allows users to access data about parking lots. Use the open ParkWhiz API for source data:

[https://www.parkwhiz.com/developers](https://www.parkwhiz.com/developers)

You can obtain an API key by signing up for a free account.

#### Coding Options
##### Front End (Web)
Create a single-page web application that allows end users to interact with the service. Feel free to include any features that seem relevant, useful, and/or just plain cool given the data available.


##### Back End
Create an API that allows client apps to access all data available through ParkWhiz data. Clients should be able to create user accounts in your system as well as create, retrieve and remove "favorite" parking locations with customizable names. Include documentation for your API in the form of a README.md file.

#### Review
When reviewing your submission, we'll be looking at the following:
- Interface Quality
  - Is the interface's design and implementation (UI for front end, API interface for back end) polished and consistent?

- Code Quality
  - Is the code reasonably easy to understand and well-organized?
  - Are there tests verifying correct behavior for critical functionality?


When you're all done, put it up somewhere on the web that we can see it (Amazon S3 or EC2, Heroku, etc.)! We'll take some time to interact with the live app.

The source code for your solution should be submitted in the form of a link to a github repo under your own account or as a *.zip or *.tgz file emailed to [engineering@luxevalet.com](mailto:engineering@luxevalet.com).

## Luxe Coding Challenges

A collection of coding challenges for Luxe Engineering.

***
#### Description
Create a service that allows users to access data about parking lots. Use the open ParkWhiz API for source data:
[https://www.parkwhiz.com/developers](https://www.parkwhiz.com/developers)

You can obtain an API key by signing up for a free account.

#### Coding Options
##### Front End (Web)
Create a single-page web application that allows end users to interact with the service. Feel free to include any features that seem relevant, useful, and/or just plain cool given the data available.


##### Backend
Create an API that allows client apps to access all data available through ParkWhiz data. The data format should be JSON. Clients should be able to create user accounts in your system as well as create, retrieve and remove "favorite" parking locations with customizable names. The data should be retrievable across server instances and restarts, so you'll need to use a persistent data store. Include documentation for your API in the form of a README.md file.

#### Bonus Points
Feel free to use any languages, frameworks and platforms you'd like. We think great developers can pick up any unfamiliar tools as/when needed, and it's not a requirement that you use a particular stack. That said, we'd be especially interested in solutions built in part with modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g. Angular or React for the front end and Node.js for the backend). If you're familiar with these already (or have been wanting to learn), you might want to take this opportunity to show us what you've got! :)

#### Time Limit
Estimated time to complete the basic requirements is ~4 hours. Submissions should be received within 1 week from the date you received the challenge description.

#### Review
When reviewing your submission, we'll be looking at the following:
- Interface Quality
  - Is the interface's design and implementation (UI for front end, API for backend) polished and consistent?

- Code Quality
  - Is the code reasonably easy to understand and well-organized?
  - Are there tests verifying correct behavior for critical functionality?


When you're all done, put it up somewhere on the web that we can see it (Amazon S3 or EC2, Heroku, etc.)! We'll take some time to interact with the live app.

The source code for your solution should be submitted in the form of a link to a github repo under your own account or as a *.zip or *.tgz file emailed to [engineering@luxevalet.com](mailto:engineering@luxevalet.com).
